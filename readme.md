## üìã Benchmark Report Template

Each benchmark report should include:

- **Package Information**: Pricing, specifications, and provider details
- **Table of Contents**: Quick navigation to different benchmark sections
- **YABS Benchmark**: Complete system performance overview
- **Bench.Monster Benchmark**: Global network performance
- **Bench.sh Benchmark**: Additional I/O and network tests
- **CPU Steal**: Monitor for resource overselling

## üîç Key Metrics to Look For

### CPU Performance
- **Single-core vs Multi-core**: Different workloads benefit from different CPU characteristics
- **Geekbench Scores**: Industry-standard comparison metric
- **CPU Steal**: Should be consistently 0.00% for dedicated resources

### Storage Performance
- **4K Random I/O**: Important for databases and general system responsiveness
- **Sequential I/O**: Important for large file operations
- **Consistency**: Look for stable performance across multiple test runs

### Network Performance
- **Local Network**: Tests within the same region/datacenter
- **Global Connectivity**: Tests to major global locations
- **Upload vs Download**: Asymmetric performance may indicate bandwidth limitations

## üöÄ Running Your Own Benchmarks

To replicate these benchmarks on your own VPS:

1. **Install required tools** (usually pre-installed on most Linux distributions):
   ```bash
   # Update system packages
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   
   # Install monitoring tools if needed
   apt install sysstat curl wget -y
   ```

2. **Run the benchmark suite**:
   ```bash
   # YABS (comprehensive)
   curl -sL https://yabs.sh | bash -s -- -r
   
   # Bench.Monster (global network)
   curl -sL bench.monster | bash
   
   # Bench.sh (quick overview)
   wget -qO- bench.sh | bash
   
   # Monitor CPU steal (run for several minutes)
   mpstat 1
   ```

3. **Document the results** using the provided template
